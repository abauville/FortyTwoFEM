# FortyTwoFEM

FortyTwo FEM is a MATLAB-based Finite Element implementation. The goals of FortyTwoFEM are two-fold:

- to provide a clean, modular and stable code that serves as a basis for the development of more advanced algorithms.
- to provide a code for students to learn from and for non-specialists to use.
FortyTwo FEM uses functions from:

- MUTILS (http://milamin.sourceforge.net/downloads)
- SuiteSparse (http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html)
- Triangle (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html)
