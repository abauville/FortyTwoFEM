# FortyTwoFEM

FortyTwo FEM is thought as a community developed MATLAB-based MILAMIN-like Finite Element implementation . The goals of FortyTwoFEM are two-fold:

- to provide a clean, modular and stable code that serves as a basis for the development of more advanced algorithms.
- to provide a code for students to learn from and for non-specialists to use.
FortyTwo FEM uses functions from:

- MUTILS (http://milamin.sourceforge.net/downloads)
- SuiteSparse (http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html)
- Triangle (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html)

The following sections serve as a design document for the code. Feel free to comment and edit it.
